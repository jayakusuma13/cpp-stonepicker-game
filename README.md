# cpp-stonepicker-game
This is a little project of mine, it's a game about taking stone. I'll explain more in readme.md

#how it works
This is a game consisting of 2 players. Before the game starts, you need to specify how many stones are available to be picked. Then, each player gets a turn to pick between 1 to 4 stones, the loop repeats until there is no stones available, and the player with the most stone picked wins.

It's a simple game.

#note
I used Indonesian language to write this code, so you will find it pretty confusing to read. I'll try to translate it in the meantime
